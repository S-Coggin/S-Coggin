# Hi, I’m Sara 👋

I’m a Software Engineer at Duos Technologies where I work on scalable backend systems, containerized GoLang microservices, and enterprise infrastructure platforms.

🔐 Most of my engineering work is proprietary and lives inside private repositories at [@duos-sarac](https://github.com/duos-sarac) which doesn’t reflect on this public GitHub profile.

🧠 My daily work includes writing containerized GoLang services, release automation, API design, and enterprise-scale backend architecture.

🛠️ My current stack includes GoLang, PHP (Laravel), Docker, REST APIs, and release automation. I’m especially passionate about solving complex system problems and building architecture that scales cleanly and securely.

⚡ Fun fact: I write code by day and fiction by night. Somewhere in between, I kick things (constructively) in Taekwondo class. 🥋💥

✨ Always curious, always iterating. Thanks for stopping by!

- Strengthening cross-functional dev practices (code review, version tagging, structured deployments)
- Expanding leadership and system visibility by contributing to end-to-end planning, not just feature implementation
- Currently learning more about both Edge & Cloud computing. 
- Ongoing: Exploring where language, logic, and system design converge to build better tools for real-world complexity
