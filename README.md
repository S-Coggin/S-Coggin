# Hi, I’m Sara 👋

I’m a Software Engineer at Duos Technologies where I work on scalable backend systems, containerized GoLang microservices, and enterprise infrastructure platforms.

⚠️ Most of my current work lives in private repositories under my organization profile @duos-sarac, where I contribute to proprietary backend systems and GoLang microservices.”

📈 While it may not show on the surface, I’ve been deep in the code — building features, writing containerized GoLang services and APIs, managing releases, and contributing to enterprise-scale backend systems that keep real infrastructure running. Most of that work lives behind private doors at @duos-sarac. 🔐

🛠️ My current stack includes GoLang, PHP (Laravel), Docker, REST APIs, and release automation. I’m especially passionate about solving complex system problems and building architecture that scales cleanly and securely.

⚡ Fun fact: I write code by day and fiction by night. Somewhere in between, I kick things (constructively) in Taekwondo class. 🥋💥

✨ Always curious, always iterating. Thanks for stopping by!
