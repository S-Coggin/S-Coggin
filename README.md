# Hi, I’m Sara 👋

I’m a Software Engineer at Duos Technologies where I work on scalable backend systems, containerized GoLang microservices, and enterprise infrastructure platforms.

🔐 Most of my recent work is proprietary and lives under my organization profile [@duos-sarac](https://github.com/duos-sarac), supporting virtual inspection systems and internal toolchains used across 20+ client deployments.

🛠️ My current stack includes GoLang, PHP (Laravel), Docker, REST APIs, and release automation. I’m especially passionate about solving complex system problems and building architecture that scales cleanly and securely.

💡 My path into tech was non-linear — I began in creative writing, transitioned through technical documentation and ESOL instruction, and eventually paired my love of language with logical systems through programming. I believe code is just another way to tell stories — with structure, intention, and impact.

- Project Management: Jira, GitHub Projects, Release Automation
- Other: JSON, XML/SGML, Technical Documentation, Version Control

🚀 Highlighted Work & Recent Goals
- Led release management across 20+ enterprise deployments (Amtrak, CSX, CN), coordinating code prep, versioning, and post-deploy validations
- Developed and containerized key GoLang microservices (Event Router, Notification Service, Auth Service) for internal platform infrastructure
- Refactored legacy PHP codebases into streamlined, secure deployment pipelines
- Built and configured modular, multi-tenant UI components for vCentraco and upcoming R4 systems

🔍 Current Focus Areas
- Deepening backend architecture skills: container orchestration, secure API design, and service-to-service communication
- Strengthening cross-functional dev practices (code review, version tagging, structured deployments)
- Expanding leadership and system visibility by contributing to end-to-end planning, not just feature implementation
- Ongoing: Exploring where language, logic, and system design converge to build better tools for real-world complexity


🌱 I’m currently learning 
- More on both Edge & Cloud computing. 

⚡ Fun fact: I write code by day and fiction by night. Somewhere in between, I kick things (constructively) in Taekwondo class. 🥋💥
